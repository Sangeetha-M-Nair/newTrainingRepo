**To make a copy of object in javascript, it provides two ways ...**

    Using Object.assign

It has 3 parts 1-target obj which is represented by {},
2-source object
3-changes we need to be added to the object

    Using spread operator represented as ...

more simpler way

    eg:- let obj3 = {...obj1,city: "London",name: "Sangeetha M Nair"}

**Currying** also known as **Wrapper functions**
Currying is an advanced technique of working with functions. Itâ€™s used not only in JavaScript, but in other languages as well.

Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

It takes another function as an argument.

in js we can pass function as an argument we can also return function as a result
artial function : They are nearly same as curry functions with the difference that the Partial function can take
any no of args while in case of curry we take only one argument.
Example :

        const add = x => (y, z) => x + y + z;   <Partial>

        const add = x => y => z => x + y + z;   <curry>

`AssIgnment create a calculator and implement same using partial and curry function`
