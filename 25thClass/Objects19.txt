In JS objects and arrays are related .
Arrays have fixed index starting from 0.
In js index is the properties name.
In js we can create an empty object by using  {}.


To simplify the process of creating the object js make use of classes.
a class is a template using which we can create objects with predefined attributes and functions.
there are two ways of creating objects in javascript.
1 primitive way using functions.
2 class oriented way.



When we create an object using any of these above method we have to rew a keyword new.



>> Inheritence is a property in which a class can get properties and functions from other class.
for eg: employee and manager ..here manager is also an emoployee
here employee is a manager so there is a 'is a ' relationship.
so we can implement it with the help of inheritence.


Javascript support object orientedness with the help of extend keyword.
